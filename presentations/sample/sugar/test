## With the following array

<pre class="code javascript" >
var fruits = [
  { name: 'cherry', count: 12 },
  ...
];
</pre>

### Use `Sugar` framework to...

* use `sortBy` with `fruits` to sort the **count** in **descending** order
* use `forEach` with the sorted results to ...
* ... use `assign` to write the message 'total <fruit> count is <count>'
* ... write each result using `console.log`

*No need to declare the array, it's already provided as part of the test*
