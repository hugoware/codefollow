[explanation]

## Create a `Counter` class

* _declare_ a function named `Counter` to be used as a `class`
* _declare_ a property named `value` that **holds the counter value**
* _declare_ a function named `increment` that **increases the counter value by 1**
* _declare_ a function named `reset` that **sets the counter to 0**
* accept a **default value** when passed into the `constructor` _(default to zero if no argument is provided)_

_(Only numbers will be used, don't worry about the constructor value type)_
