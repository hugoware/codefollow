# OOP: Prototype
## Introduction

* Another approach to creating JavaScript classes is to use `prototype`
* `prototype` exists on all JavaScript objects, but it's not enumerable, so you won't see it when iterating an object's properties
* Instantiated objects inherit whatever has been defined for its `prototype`
